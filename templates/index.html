  👋 Hi, my name is Ashutosh(nickname Palash)
</h1>
<h3>
  Who am I?
</h3>

<p>
  I'm about 30 years old, making no money, having no girlfriend, living at home with my parents. I wasted a very long period of my life on the persuit of perfection which I believe, resulted in my current personality which I don't like. My goal for the rest of my life is not to give perfection much of a priority. So I'm in the process of killing my self and forging a new one which doesn't give fucks all the time. I'm really tired of giving fucks!
</p>

<p>
  I love learning and making things. Currently learning web dev stuffs with a focus on JavaScript and preparing myself for my first dev job.
