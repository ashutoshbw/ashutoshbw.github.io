### Limitations

To have backlinks in posts work smoothly, the following things should be followed:

- For each blog post create a dedicated folder for it. The folder name should follow the following rules:
  - Only lowercase English letters and dash(`-`) are allowed.
  - Do not start with a dash.
  - Do not use multiple adjacent dashes.
- Do not use the `slug` frontmatter property of a post to change its slug.
